    <h1>Welcome</h1>

    <p>Hello and welcome to my personal website. I'm <strong>Maria Werhahn</strong>, an astrophysicist currently working as a postdoctoral fellow at the <a href="https://www.mpa-garching.mpg.de" target="_blank">Max Planck Institute for Astrophysics (MPA)</a> in Garching, Germany. Before joining MPA, I completed my PhD in 2022 at the <a href="https://www.aip.de" target="_blank">Leibniz Institute for Astrophysics Potsdam (AIP)</a>.</p>

    <p>My research focuses on the role of magnetic fields and cosmic rays in galaxy formation, in particular in combining simulations with observations.</p>

    <p>This website provides an overview of my scientific work, including selected publications and ongoing projects.</p>

    <p>Thank you for visiting, and feel free to <a href="/contact">get in touch</a> if you'd like to collaborate or learn more.</p>
