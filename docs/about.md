	<p class="intro">I study how cosmic rays and magnetic fields influence the evolution of galaxies. Using advanced simulations and modeling tools, I connect theoretical predictions with observations across radio and gamma-ray wavelengths. My work helps reveal how these components influence star formation, galactic winds, and shape the cosmic environment around galaxies.</p>

  <h2>Personal Background</h2>
  <p>I am originally from Garmisch-Partenkirchen, and I completed my PhD at the Leibniz Institute for Astrophysics Potsdam (AIP) in 2022. Currently, I am a postdoctoral fellow at the Max Planck Institute for Astrophysics (MPA) in Garching, Germany.</p>
  
  <p>Outside of research, I enjoy hiking, skiing, dancing, reading and playing the piano.</p>
